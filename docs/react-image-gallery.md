Here's a basic example on how to use PhotoSwipe lightbox with React to create a simple image gallery. [Browse and edit code on Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-gvpqsb?file=SimpleGallery.js).

If you want to provide images data directly to PhotoSwipe, refer to [Data sources page](data-sources).

There is no special component specifically for React yet, if you developed one (for v5) - please let me know and I'll link it here.
